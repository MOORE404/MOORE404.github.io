            I am a talented piano player and amatuer orchestra composer.<br><br>
              In my free time outside of computer science, I like to explore music composition and arrangements.<br>
              I'm developing my skills in music creation as its quite a relaxing and exciting journey that can be a <br> 
              nice break from being stuck on a problem for what feels like 999999 hours.
            <br>
